# Learn Go

Learn Go is a community sourced book for experienced developers coming to Go from other languages.  Rather than focusing on teaching fundamental patterns, we will focus on how to apply the knowledge you already have to Go.

This book will be seeded with learning materials from Brian Ketelsen's Go training classes.  These materials are simply a starting point.  The book should be a living document, and open to contributions of all sizes from anyone.

This book is continuously deployed from the source code on [Github](https://github.com/thewondertwins/learngo).  You can contribute new content and translations there.  Authors and translators of all experience levels are welcomed and encouraged to join this educational project.
